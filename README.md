# Koala ContentBundle
This is my attempt at creating a simple CMS. The plan is to use [Mercury Editor](http://jejacks0n.github.com/mercury/) as a Frontend Editor.

More information will come when this is more usable...

## Requirements
* [gedmo-doctrine-extensions](https://github.com/l3pp4rd/DoctrineExtensions)
* [Stof/DoctrineExtensionsBundle](https://github.com/stof/StofDoctrineExtensionsBundle)
